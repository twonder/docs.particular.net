The Azure transports for NServiceBus enable the use of Azure Queues and Azure Service Bus as the underlying transports used by NServiceBus. It can be used in multiple scenarios:

 * Cloud hosting scenario: An NServiceBus endpoint is hosted as a cloud service and communicates with another endpoint located in another cloud service through the use of one of the Azure transports for NServiceBus.
 * Hybrid scenario: An NServiceBus endpoint is hosted on-premise and uses one of the Azure transports for NServiceBus to communicate with another NServiceBus endpoint hosted on a Cloud Service and/or on-premise.

As part of the Azure support for NServiceBus, you can choose between two options provided by the Azure platform:

 * Azure Storage Queues
 * Azure Service Bus

Each of these two options has separate features, capabilities, and usage characteristics. A detailed comparison and discussion of when to select which is beyond the scope of this document. To help decide which option best suits your application's needs, review the Azure article "[Azure Queues and Azure Service Bus Queues - Compared and Contrasted](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/service-bus-azure-and-service-bus-queues-compared-contrasted/)".


## Configuring for cloud service hosting

For a detailed description of the cloud service configuration in Azure, see "[Set Up a Cloud Service for Azure](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/hh124108.aspx#bk_Config)".

To configure NServiceBus to connect to a specific Azure storage account (for Azure Queues) or a Azure Service Bus namespace, you must set the [appropriate connection string for each option](http://www.connectionstrings.com/windows-azure/).


### Azure Storage Queues

In the Azure Service Configuration file (ServiceConfiguration.cscfg), add the following sections:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ServiceConfiguration serviceName="AzureService"
xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ServiceHosting/2008/10/ServiceConfiguration"
schemaVersion="2013-03.2.0">
  <Role name="{role name}">
    <Instances count="1" />
    <ConfigurationSettings>
      <Setting name="AzureQueueConfig.ConnectionString"
      value="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName={your account name here};
      AccountKey={your account key here}" />
      <Setting name="AzureQueueConfig.QueueName" value="{your queue name here}" />
...
    </ConfigurationSettings>
  </Role>
</ServiceConfiguration>
```

The "AzureQueueConfig.ConnectionString" for Azure Queues follows this format:

    DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=myAccount;AccountKey=myKey;QueueEndpoint=customEndpoint;

Alternatively, you can use the Azure development environment emulator by using this connection string:

    UseDevelopmentStorage=True;

In your NServiceBus solution, specify the Endpoint Configuration to use AzureStorageQueue transport:

    public class EndpointConfig : IConfigureThisEndpoint, AsA_Worker
	{
	    public void Customize(BusConfiguration builder)
	    {
	        builder.UseTransport<AzureStorageQueueTransport>();
	    }
	}


### Azure Service Bus

In the Azure Service Configuration file
(ServiceConfiguration.cscfg), add the following sections:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ServiceConfiguration serviceName="AzureService"
xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ServiceHosting/2008/10/ServiceConfiguration"
schemaVersion="2013-03.2.0">
  <Role name="{role name}">
    <Instances count="1" />
    <ConfigurationSettings>
      <Setting name="AzureServiceBusQueueConfig.ConnectionString"
      value="Endpoint=sb://{your namespace here}.servicebus.windows.net/;
      SharedAccessKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey;
      SharedAccessKey={your shared access key here}" />
...
    </ConfigurationSettings>
  </Role>
</ServiceConfiguration>
```


The "AzureServiceBusQueueConfig.ConnectionString" for Azure Service Bus namespace connection string can be retrieved from the Azure portal using an authorized account.

In your NServiceBus solution, specify the endpoint configuration to use AzureServiceBus transport:

    public class EndpointConfig : IConfigureThisEndpoint, AsA_Worker
	{
	    public void Customize(BusConfiguration builder)
	    {
	        builder.UseTransport<AzureServiceBusTransport>();
	    }
	}


## Configuring for on-premise hosting

In the configuration file for the application (web.config or app.config), add an `NServiceBus\Transport` element as follows:

```
<configuration> 
...
 <connectionStrings>
    <add name="NServiceBus/Transport" connectionString="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;
               AccountName={your account name here};AccountKey={your account key here}"/>
  </connectionStrings>
...
</configuration>
```

The connection string value should be set according to the selected Azure options selected (either a Azure Queues connection string or a Azure Service Bus namespace).

NOTE: Setting the connection string in the application configuration files (web.config or app.config) is overridden by any settings placed in the service configuration file (ServiceConfiguration.cscfg) if one exists. This allows a cloud hosting scenario to override an on-premise deployment scenario, with minimal changes to the configuration, while allowing easy updates to the deployment configuration through the service configuration files only, with no need to update the applications configuration files.
