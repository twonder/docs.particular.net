Support for routing log entries to [NLog](http://nlog-project.org/) is compatible with NServiceBus 5 and above.

There is a [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus.NLog/) package available that allows for simple integration of NServiceBus and NLog.


## Usage

## Filtering

If NServiceBus writes a significant amount of information to the log. To limit this information you can use the filtering features of your underlying logging framework.

For example to limit log output to a specific namespace.

Here is a code configuration example for adding a [Rule](https://github.com/nlog/NLog/wiki/Configuration-file#rules).
