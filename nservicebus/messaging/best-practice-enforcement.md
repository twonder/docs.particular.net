By default NServiceBus will make sure that you are following [messaging best practices](messages-events-commands.md) for the messages you define as either Commands or Events. While this worked it caused other features like [auto subscribe](publish-subscribe/controlling-what-is-subscribed.md) to stop working since only `Events` are auto subscribed.

You can bypass these enforcements by defining all your messages as plain messages.

NOTE: In Version 6 you can now override the default behavior

You can now turn this feature on and off on the endpoint level using:

snippet:DisableBestPracticeEnforcementPerEndpoint

or at the message level using:

snippet:DisableBestPracticeEnforcementPerMessage
