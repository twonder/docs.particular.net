## Selecting [Transports](/nservicebus/transports/) to use

`configure.MsmqTransport()` has been obsoleted, please use `configure.UseTransport<Msmq>()` instead.


## [Sags](/nservicebus/sagas)


### Enabling Sagas

The API for enabling sagas has changed.

snippet: 3to4EnableSagas


### ConfigureHowToFindSaga

The API for configuring how to map a message to a saga has changed.

snippet:3to4ConfigureHowToFindSaga


## Change in behavior when no handler found

When a message is received for which there is no message handlers it is now considered an error and the received message will be forwarded to the configured error queue.

For more information see [Handling a Message](/nservicebus/handlers/).


## Critical Errors

The API for defining critical errors has changed. See [Critical Errors](/nservicebus/hosting/critical-errors.md) for more information.


## Setting outgoing Message headers

The API for setting outgoing message headers has changed.

snippet:3to4SetMessageHeader

See [Header Manipulation](/nservicebus/messaging/header-manipulation.md).


## Distributor


### Enabling a Distributor

The API for enabling an endpoint to behave as a distributor has changed.

snippet:3to4RunDistributor


### Enlisting with a Distributor

The API for enlisting with a distributor has changed.

snippet:3to4EnlistWithDistributor


## Persistence

The configuration API to select persistence has been changed in Version 4. Please see below for details.


### RavenDB Version

NServiceBus V4.0 requires newer version of RavenDB. See [RavenDB Version Compatibility](/nservicebus/ravendb/version-compatibility.md) for more details.


### Timeouts

`configure.RunTimeoutManagerWithInMemoryPersistence()` has been obsoleted and you should now enable InMemory storage for timeouts using `configure.UseInMemoryTimeoutPersister()`. More info on InMemory persistence [here](/nservicebus/persistence/in-memory.md).


## Default transaction isolation level

The default transaction [IsolationLevel](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.transactions.isolationlevel.aspx) is now `ReadCommitted`. To revert to `Serializable`:

snippet:3to4RevertToSerializable


## INeedToInstallInfrastructure is deprecated

Use `INeedToInstallSomething` instead. See [NServiceBus Installers](/nservicebus/operations/installers.md) for more information.


## SecondLevelRetries

The type `SecondLevelRetries` has been moved from the `NServiceBus.Management.Retries` namespace to the `NServiceBus.Features` namespace. See [Automatic Retries](/nservicebus/errors/automatic-retries.md) for more information.


### Disabling

The api for disabling SecondLevelRetries has changed.

snippet:3to4DisableSecondLevelRetries


## TransactionalTransport

The type `NServiceBus.Unicast.Transport.Transsactional.TransactionalTransport` has been renamed to `NServiceBus.Unicast.Transport.TransportReceiver`.


## INeedInitialization moved

The interface `INeedInitialization` has been moved from `NServiceBus.Config.INeedInitialization` to `NServiceBus.INeedInitialization`. If you get a `ambiguous reference` error you may need to fully qualify your usage of that interface. See [Life-cycle initialization](/nservicebus/lifecycle/ineedinitialization.md) for more information.


## INeedToInstallSomething

The `INeedToInstallSomething` interface is now resolved via the container. See [NServiceBus Installers](/nservicebus/operations/installers.md) for more information.


## License detection changes

The locations that NServiceBus will scan for a valid license has been expanded. See [How to install your NServiceBus license file](/nservicebus/licensing/license-management.md) for more information.


## MsmqTransportConfig deprecated

The `MsmqTransportConfig` section has been deprecated in favor of `TransportConfig`.

snippet:3to4TransportConfig


## PowerShell cmdlet Updates

NServiceBus PowerShell cmdlets have moved to NServiceBus.PowerShell.dll. See [Management using PowerShell](/nservicebus/operations/management-using-powershell.md) for more information.


## Serialization

`configure.JsonSerializer()` has been obsoleted, please use `Configure.Serialization.Json();` instead. More info on supported serializers [here](/nservicebus/serialization/).

The `XmlSerializer` will now automatically escape outgoing messages containing invalid characters.

WARNING: If a message with encoded characters is sent from Version 4 to Version 3 an exception will be thrown and that message will be forwarded to the error queue. From there it can be handled manually and retried.


## Logging

The NServiceBus NuGet package no longer depends on `log4net` and this means that if you where using `log4net` in Version 3 that dependency may be removed when you do a NuGet package upgrade. To solve this just install the latest `log4net` Version 1.2 package into your project. You can find more details on integrating with `log4net` [here](/nservicebus/logging/log4net.md).


## Sagas now auto subscribe

Sagas have been changed to act the same as Handlers in their event subscription behavior. See [Exclude sagas from auto subscribe](/nservicebus/messaging/publish-subscribe/controlling-what-is-subscribed.md#automatic-subscriptions-exclude-sagas-from-auto-subscribe) for how to revert to the previous behavior.


## Transaction settings

Most of the configuration API's for transactions have been changed, please see below. You can find more details on transaction settings [here](/nservicebus/messaging/transactions.md).


### Disabling transactions

To disable transactions when receiving you now have to use `Configure.Transactions.Disable();` instead of the deprecated `configure.DontUseTransactions();`.


### Adjusting transaction isolation level

`configure.IsolationLevel(level)` has been deprecated, please use `Configure.Transactions.Advanced(x => x.IsolationLevel(level))` instead.


### Adjusting transaction timeouts

`configure.TransactionTimeout(timeout)` has been deprecated, please use `Configure.Transactions.Advanced(x => x.DefaultTimeout(timeout))` instead.


## Rename Principal Replacement

The Principal Replacement API has been renamed.

See the [Appending username using headers](/samples/username-header/) sample for more information.
