This sample show two approaches appending the current username to outgoing messages and then extracting that value during message handling.


### Fake Principle

For demonstration purposes, prior to sending a message, the `Thread.CurrentPrincipal` will be replaced with a new instance. Normally in production the `Thread.CurrentPrincipal` would be either the impersonated user from IIS or the current user sending a message.

## Custom Header with a Mutator

The recommended approach to capturing the current user is to create a transport mutator that extracts the current identity and adds that to the header of every outgoing message.


### Outgoing Mutator

The outgoing mutator extracts `Thread.CurrentPrincipal.Identity.Name` and appends it to a message header.

#### Register the Mutator

### The Handler

From within a Handler (or Saga) this value can be used as such.

## Manipulating the incoming Thread.CurrentPrincipal

WARNING: This approach is only supported in Version 4 and below. For Version 5 and above use the above approach.

This approach uses the "Principal Manipulation" API that exists in both Versions 3 and 4. 

WARNING: It is important to note that, on the receiving end, this API actually uses a fake windows principle, that has the name from the header, and **not** the real authenticated principal of the user who sent the message.


### Configure Principal Manipulation

Principal Manipulation is configured on the receiving end as part of the bus startup.

### Consuming the Principal

When a message is handled the `Thread.CurrentPrincipal` is replaced prior to and message handlers being executed. It can then be consumed as such.
